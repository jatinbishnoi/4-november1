1.)
Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands, which can be values or variables. They play a crucial role in programming by enabling developers to manipulate data and perform various actions. Here are some key aspects of the role of operators in JavaScript:

1. **Arithmetic Operations:**
   - JavaScript includes standard arithmetic operators such as `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and `%` (modulo). These operators allow for basic mathematical calculations.

2. **Assignment Operators:**
   - Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`) are used to assign values to variables. They help in updating the value of a variable based on some computation.

3. **Comparison Operators:**
   - Comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) are used to compare values and return a Boolean result (`true` or `false`). They are essential for decision-making and flow control in programs.

4. **Logical Operators:**
   - Logical operators (`&&` for AND, `||` for OR, `!` for NOT) are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values. They are crucial for creating conditional statements and controlling the program flow.

5. **Unary Operators:**
   - Unary operators operate on a single operand. Examples include the unary plus `+` and unary minus `-`, which can convert a value to a number with the respective sign.

6. **Increment and Decrement Operators:**
   - The `++` (increment) and `--` (decrement) operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1, respectively.

7. **Bitwise Operators:**
   - Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`) manipulate the binary representation of numbers at the bit level. They are used in more advanced scenarios, such as working with binary data or optimizing certain algorithms.

8. **Conditional (Ternary) Operator:**
   - The conditional operator (`? :`) is a shorthand way of writing an `if-else` statement and is useful for concise conditional expressions.

Operators are essential in programming because they provide a way to perform computations, make decisions, and control the flow of a program. By using operators, developers can create complex algorithms, express relationships between variables, and build powerful, dynamic applications. Understanding how to use operators effectively is fundamental to writing efficient and expressive code in JavaScript and many other programming languages.


2.)
Operators in JavaScript can be categorized based on their functionality. Here are the main categories:

1. **Arithmetic Operators:**
   - Perform mathematical calculations.
   - Examples: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulo).

   ```javascript
   let a = 5;
   let b = 2;

   console.log(a + b); // 7
   console.log(a - b); // 3
   console.log(a * b); // 10
   console.log(a / b); // 2.5
   console.log(a % b); // 1
   ```

2. **Assignment Operators:**
   - Assign values to variables.
   - Examples: `=` (assignment), `+=` (addition assignment), `-=` (subtraction assignment), `*=` (multiplication assignment), `/=` (division assignment).

   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   x += 5; // equivalent to x = x + 5
   console.log(x); // 15
   ```

3. **Comparison Operators:**
   - Compare values and return Boolean results.
   - Examples: `==` (equality), `===` (strict equality), `!=` (inequality), `!==` (strict inequality), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to).

   ```javascript
   let a = 5;
   let b = '5';

   console.log(a == b);  // true (loose equality)
   console.log(a === b); // false (strict equality)
   ```

4. **Logical Operators:**
   - Perform logical operations on Boolean values.
   - Examples: `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), `!` (logical NOT).

   ```javascript
   let isTrue = true;
   let isFalse = false;

   console.log(isTrue && isFalse); // false (true if both operands are true)
   console.log(isTrue || isFalse); // true (true if at least one operand is true)
   console.log(!isTrue);           // false (negation)
   ```

5. **Unary Operators:**
   - Operate on a single operand.
   - Examples: `+` (unary plus), `-` (unary minus), `++` (increment), `--` (decrement).

   ```javascript
   let num = 5;

   console.log(+num);   // 5 (unary plus)
   console.log(-num);   // -5 (unary minus)
   console.log(++num);  // 6 (increment by 1)
   console.log(--num);  // 5 (decrement by 1)
   ```

6. **Conditional (Ternary) Operator:**
   - A shorthand for the `if-else` statement.
   - Example: `condition ? expr1 : expr2`

   ```javascript
   let age = 20;
   let status = (age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';
   console.log(status); // 'Adult'
   ```

These categories cover the most commonly used operators in JavaScript. Keep in mind that some operators may fall into multiple categories based on their usage context. Understanding these operators is fundamental for writing effective and expressive JavaScript code.

3.)
In JavaScript, operators are categorized based on the number of operands they operate on. Here's a differentiation between unary, binary, and ternary operators, along with examples for each:

1. **Unary Operators:**
   - **Definition:** Unary operators work with only one operand.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let x = 5;
     let y = -x; // Unary minus, operates on the single operand x
     console.log(y); // -5
     ```

     ```javascript
     let a = true;
     let b = !a; // Logical NOT, operates on the single operand a
     console.log(b); // false
     ```

     ```javascript
     let count = 0;
     count++; // Increment, operates on the single operand count
     console.log(count); // 1
     ```

2. **Binary Operators:**
   - **Definition:** Binary operators work with two operands.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let a = 5;
     let b = 3;
     let sum = a + b; // Addition, operates on the two operands a and b
     console.log(sum); // 8
     ```

     ```javascript
     let x = 10;
     let y = 3;
     let quotient = x / y; // Division, operates on the two operands x and y
     console.log(quotient); // 3.333...
     ```

     ```javascript
     let str1 = 'Hello';
     let str2 = ' World';
     let result = str1 + str2; // String concatenation, operates on the two operands str1 and str2
     console.log(result); // 'Hello World'
     ```

3. **Ternary Operator:**
   - **Definition:** The ternary operator is the only ternary operator in JavaScript, and it works with three operands. It is a shorthand for an `if-else` statement.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let age = 20;
     let status = (age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';
     // The condition (age >= 18) is the first operand,
     // 'Adult' is the second operand (expr1), and 'Minor' is the third operand (expr2)
     console.log(status); // 'Adult'
     ```

     ```javascript
     let number = -5;
     let absValue = (number >= 0) ? number : -number;
     // The condition (number >= 0) is the first operand,
     // number is the second operand (expr1), and -number is the third operand (expr2)
     console.log(absValue); // 5
     ```

These distinctions are based on the number of operands an operator works with, and understanding this classification helps in better comprehension and usage of operators in JavaScript.
4.)
**Precedence** and **associativity** are crucial concepts when it comes to understanding how JavaScript evaluates expressions containing multiple operators. They determine the order in which operators are applied, ensuring that expressions are evaluated consistently.

1. **Precedence:**
   - **Definition:** Precedence refers to the priority level assigned to operators. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let result = 2 + 3 * 4;
     // In this expression, multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+)
     // So, 3 * 4 is evaluated first, and then 2 is added to the result.
     console.log(result); // 14
     ```

   - **Common Precedence Levels:**
     - Multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulo (`%`) have higher precedence than addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`).
     - Comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`) have lower precedence than arithmetic operators.

   - **Changing Precedence with Parentheses:**
     - Parentheses can be used to explicitly specify the order of evaluation, overriding the default precedence.

     ```javascript
     let result = (2 + 3) * 4;
     // With parentheses, addition is evaluated first, and then multiplication.
     console.log(result); // 20
     ```

2. **Associativity:**
   - **Definition:** Associativity defines the order in which operators with the same precedence are evaluated when they appear consecutively in an expression.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let result = 2 + 3 + 4;
     // Both + operators have the same precedence.
     // The associativity of the + operator is left-to-right.
     // So, 2 + 3 is evaluated first, and then the result is added to 4.
     console.log(result); // 9
     ```

   - **Common Associativity:**
     - Most operators in JavaScript are left-to-right associative, meaning they are evaluated from left to right when they have the same precedence.
     - The assignment operator (`=`) is right-to-left associative.

   - **Changing Associativity with Parentheses:**
     - Like with precedence, parentheses can be used to explicitly specify the order of evaluation and change the associativity.

     ```javascript
     let result = 2 + (3 + 4);
     // The parentheses force the inner addition to be evaluated first.
     console.log(result); // 9
     ```

**Importance of Understanding Precedence and Associativity:**
   - **Correctness:** Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing correct expressions. Misunderstanding or neglecting precedence and associativity can lead to unintended results.
   - **Readability:** Code that follows common precedence and associativity rules tends to be more readable. Others can easily understand the intended order of operations.
   - **Avoiding Bugs:** Knowing how JavaScript evaluates expressions helps in preventing common bugs related to incorrect order of operations.

In summary, a clear understanding of precedence and associativity is essential for writing reliable and readable JavaScript code. It ensures that expressions are evaluated in the intended order, leading to correct and predictable behavior.

// Display the result
console.log("Principal Amount: $" + principalAmount);
console.log("Interest Rate: " + interestRate + "%");
console.log("Time Period: " + timePeriod + " years");
console.log("Simple Interest: $" + simpleInterest.toFixed(2));
```

In this program:

- The `calculateSimpleInterest` function takes three parameters (`principal`, `rate`, and `time`) and calculates the simple interest using the provided formula.
- Example values for the principal amount, interest rate, and time period are given.
- The `calculateSimpleInterest` function is called with these values, and the result is displayed in the console.

  // BMI formula: weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
  let bmi = weight / (height * height);
  return bmi;
}

// Example values
let weightInKg = 70;    // Weight in kilograms
let heightInMeters = 1.75;  // Height in meters

// Calculate BMI using the function
let bmiResult = calculateBMI(weightInKg, heightInMeters);

// Display the result
console.log("Weight: " + weightInKg + " kg");
console.log("Height: " + heightInMeters + " m");

Certainly! Here's a simple JavaScript program that calculates the area of a circle given its radius (assuming a radius value of 10) using the formula \( \text{Area} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \):

```javascript
// Function to calculate the area of a circle
function calculateCircleArea(radius) {
  // Assuming Math.PI for the value of pi
  let area = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
  return area;
}

// Example radius value
let radiusValue = 10;

// Calculate the area of the circle using the function
let circleArea = calculateCircleArea(radiusValue);

// Display the result
console.log("Radius: " + radiusValue);
